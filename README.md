# Twitter-Bot

Little Twitter Bot I made, I have it follow it the Twitter Accounts @garyfromteenmom, @aayylmao, 
@dubstep4dads, @imskytrash, @yung_gravy, @richchigga, and @dril, then pull two random tweets and mash them
together. One or two of the twitter accounts may have blocked the bot because sometimes the tweets it chose had
a handle in them so that account would get tagged a lot, so I had it filter out handles in the tweets.
